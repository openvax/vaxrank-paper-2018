                 Complex (MHC) molecules is the single most selective step in
                 the recognition of pathogens by the cellular immune system.
                 The human MHC class I system (HLA-I) is extremely polymorphic.
                 The number of registered HLA-I molecules has now surpassed
                 1500. Characterizing the specificity of each separately would
                 be a major undertaking. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we have
                 drawn on a large database of known peptide-HLA-I interactions
                 to develop a bioinformatics method, which takes both peptide
                 and HLA sequence information into account, and generates
                 quantitative predictions of the affinity of any peptide-HLA-I
                 interaction. Prospective experimental validation of peptides
                 predicted to bind to previously untested HLA-I molecules,
                 cross-validation, and retrospective prediction of known HIV
                 immune epitopes and endogenous presented peptides, all
                 successfully validate this method. We further demonstrate that
                 the method can be applied to perform a clustering analysis of
                 MHC specificities and suggest using this clustering to select
                 particularly informative novel MHC molecules for future
                 biochemical and functional analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Encompassing
                 all HLA molecules, this high-throughput computational method
                 lends itself to epitope searches that are not only genome- and
                 pathogen-wide, but also HLA-wide. Thus, it offers a truly
                 global analysis of immune responses supporting rational
                 development of vaccines and immunotherapy. It also promises to
                 provide new basic insights into HLA structure-function
                 relationships. The method is available at

	a human MHC class II. Here, we present a method, NetMHCIIpan,
	that allows for pan-specific predictions of peptide binding to
	any HLA-DR molecule of known sequence. The method is derived
	from a large compilation of quantitative HLA-DR binding events
	covering 14 of the more than 500 known HLA-DR alleles. Taking
	both peptide and HLA sequence information into account, the
	method can generalize and predict peptide binding also for

	HLA class II ligands, cross-validation,

	hitherto uncharacterized HLA-DR molecules. The validation
	shows that the method can successfully predict binding for

	prediction method aiming at providing broad HLA-DR allelic

	included in the training of TEPITOPE while outperforming
	TEPITOPE on novel alleles. We propose that the method can be
	used to identify those hitherto uncharacterized alleles, which
	should be addressed experimentally in future updates of the
	method to cover the polymorphism of HLA-DR most efficiently.
	We thus conclude that the presented method meets the challenge

                 interactions with linear ligands of variable length. One such
                 receptor is the MHC class I molecule. The length preferences
                 vary depending on the MHC allele, but are generally limited to
                 peptides of length 8-11 amino acids. On this relatively simple
                 system, we developed a sequence alignment method based on
                 artificial neural networks that allows insertions and
                 deletions in the alignment. RESULTS: We show that prediction
                 methods based on alignments that include insertions and

                 trained on peptides of single lengths. Also, we illustrate how
                 the location of deletions can aid the interpretation of the
                 modes of binding of the peptide-MHC, as in the case of long
                 peptides bulging out of the MHC groove or protruding at either
                 terminus. Finally, we demonstrate that the method can learn
                 the length profile of different MHC molecules, and quantified

               testing the safety, feasibility, and immunogenicity of a
               neoantigen + Poly-ICLC vaccine derived from exome and RNA
               sequencing [1]. The personalized component of the vaccine
               consists of ten peptides (25 amino acids in length) predicted to
               contain highly expressed mutated cytotoxic T-cell epitopes.
               Selecting peptides for each patient requires a number of
               standard bioinformatics tasks such as somatic variant calling,
               sequence-based HLA typing, and class I peptide-MHC binding
               prediction, as well as new methods to determine the coding
               sequence for each identified mutation, quantify the RNA support
               for each variant allele, and scoring each vaccine peptide. We
               present the overall design of PGV, its implementation as an open
               source computational pipeline, and several independently useful
               libraries that implement aspects of mutant epitope prediction.
               One of the unique characteristics of the PGV pipeline is that
               the amino acid sequence of a candidate vaccine peptide is
               determined from RNA reads overlapping a variant [2].
               Consequently, variants which lack any evidence in RNA cannot be
               used in PGV. Determining a coding sequence from RNA allows us to
               capture atypical splicing around a mutation as well as phase
               somatic variants with nearby germline variants. Once a mutant
               coding sequence is established, candidate vaccine peptides are
               ranked by combining their predicted Class I MHC binding affinity
               with allele-specific expression [3]. We demonstrate the impact
               of different ranking criteria on vaccine efficacy using a tumor
               mouse model. Execution and dependency management of the PGV
               pipeline is orchestrated using a a novel workflow engine [4, 5]
               which allows us to run complex tools across many machines with
               fault tolerance and reproducibility. The pipeline can be run on
               single machines, local clusters, or on public infrastructure
               using the Google Cloud Platform. We hope that by making the PGV
               pipeline and its underlying components available as open source
               software we can facilitate faster experimentation in the design
               of personalized cancer vaccines. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] Citation

              can induce tumor regression. The capacity to manifest remarkably
              durable responses in some patients has been ascribed in part to T
              cells that can (a) kill tumor cells directly, (b) orchestrate
              diverse antitumor immune responses, (c) manifest long-lasting
              memory, and (d) display remarkable specificity for tumor-derived
              proteins. This specificity stems from fundamental differences
              between cancer cells and their normal counterparts in that the
              former develop protein-altering mutations and undergo epigenetic
              and genetic alterations, resulting in aberrant protein
              expression. These events can result in formation of tumor
              antigens. The identification of mutated and aberrantly expressed
              self-tumor antigens has historically been time consuming and
              laborious. While mutant antigens are usually expressed in a
              tumor-specific manner, aberrantly expressed antigens are often
              shared between cancers and, therefore, in the past, have been the
              major focus of therapeutic cancer vaccines. However, advances in
              next-generation sequencing and epitope prediction now permit the
              rapid identification of mutant tumor neoantigens. This review
              focuses on a discussion of mutant tumor neoantigens and their use
              in personalizing cancer immunotherapies.",

                 These observations indicate that neoantigen load may form a

                 by autologous T cells (neoepitopes) are ideal cancer vaccine
                 targets. They combine a favorable safety profile due to a lack
                 of expression in healthy tissues with a high likelihood of
                 immunogenicity, as T cells recognizing neoepitopes are not

                 (neoantigens) shared by patients have been explored as vaccine
                 targets for many years. Shared (``public'') mutations,
